            Orchids “steal, lie, cheat” and look impudently good while doing so. Most flowering plants offer nectar to attract pollinators and reward them for their visit. Orchids on the other hand usually trick their pollinators into pollinating them and stick the pollinarium onto the animal without rewarding it for the visit.
